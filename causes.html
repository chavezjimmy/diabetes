						<h1>MEDICATION</h1>
						<p>
				
						Diabetes causes vary depending on your genetic makeup, family history, ethnicity, health and environmental factors. There is no common diabetes cause that fits every type of diabetes as the causes of diabetes vary depending on the individual and the type. For instance; the causes of type 1 diabetes vary considerably from the causes of gestational diabetes. Similarly, the causes of type 2 diabetes are distinct from the causes of type 1 diabetes. In fact, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes causes are very different. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the pancreas cannot produce insulin, whereas type 2 diabetes is the bodyâ€™s resistance to insulin. 
 
						</p>


						<h1>DIABETES MELLITUS</h1>
						<p>
				
						Diabetes mellitus, commonly known as diabetes, is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar. The hormone insulin moves sugar from the blood into your cells to be stored or used for energy. With diabetes, your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t effectively use the insulin it does make.

Untreated high blood sugar from diabetes can damage your nerves, eyes, kidneys, and other organs.
						</p>
						<h1>Type 1 Diabetes Causes</h1>
						<p>
				
						Type 1 diabetes is caused by the immune system destroying the cells in the pancreas that make insulin. This causes diabetes by leaving the body without enough insulin to function normally. This is called an autoimmune reaction, or autoimmune cause, because the body is attacking itself.There is no specific diabetes causes, but the following triggers may be involved: Viral or bacterial infection Chemical toxins within food Unidentified component causing autoimmune reaction Underlying genetic disposition may also be a type 1 diabetes cause. 
						</p>

						<h1>Type 2 Diabetes Causes</h1>

						<p>
				
						Type 2 diabetes causes are usually multifactorial â€“ more than one diabetes cause is involved. Often, the most overwhelming factor is a family history of type 2 diabetes. This is the most likely type 2 diabetes cause. There are a variety of risk factors for type 2 diabetes, any or all of which increase the chances of developing the condition. These include: Obesity Living a sedentary lifestyle Increasing age Bad diet Other type 2 diabetes causes such as pregnancy or illness can be type 2 diabetes risk factors. 
						</p>
						<h1>Gestational diabetes causes</h1>
						<p>
						The causes of diabetes in pregnancy also known as gestational diabetes remain unknown. However, there are a number of risk factors that increase the chances of developing this condition: Family history of gestational diabetes Overweight or obese Suffer from polycystic ovary syndrome Have had a large baby weighing over 9lb Causes of gestational diabetes may also be related to ethnicity â€“ some ethnic groups have a higher risk of gestational diabetes.
