			<h1> TREATMENT OF DIABETES </h1>		
			</div>
				<div class ="tips">
						<h1>MEDICATION</h1>
						<p>
				
						Your healthcare provider may prescribe:
						•	antidepressants
						•	antianxiety
						•	antipsychotic medications
 
						</p>


						<h1>PSYCHOTHERAPY</h1>
						<p>
				
						Speaking with a therapist can help you learn skills to cope with negative feelings. You may also benefit from family or group therapy sessions. 
						</p>
						<h1>LIGHT THERAPY</h1>
						<p>
				
						Exposure to doses of white light can help regulate your mood and improve symptoms of depression. Light therapy is commonly used in seasonal affective disorder, which is now called major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern 
						</p>

						<h1>ALTERNATIVE THERAPY</h1>

						<p>
				
						Ask your healthcare provider about acupuncture or meditation. Some herbal supplements are also used to treat depression, like St. John’s wort, SAMe, and fish oil.
						Talk with your healthcare provider before taking a supplement or combining a supplement with prescription medication because some supplements can react with certain medications. Some supplements may also worsen depression or reduce the effectiveness of medication.

						<h1>TYPES OF EXERCISE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY</h1>
						<p>Aerobic exercise involves repeated and continuous movement of large muscle groups (9). Activities such as walking, cycling, jogging, and swimming rely primarily on aerobic energy-producing systems. Resistance (strength) training includes exercises with free weights, weight machines, body weight, or elastic resistance bands. Flexibility exercises improve range of motion around joints (10). Balance exercises benefit gait and prevent falls (11). Activities like tai chi and yoga combine flexibility, balance, and resistance activities.</P>
						<h1>Aerobic Exercise Benefits</h1>
						<P>Aerobic training increases mitochondrial density, insulin sensitivity, oxidative enzymes, compliance and reactivity of blood vessels, lung function, immune function, and cardiac output (12). Moderate to high volumes of aerobic activity are associated with substantially lower cardiovascular and overall mortality risks in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (13). In type 1 diabetes, aerobic training increases cardiorespiratory fitness, decreases insulin resistance, and improves lipid levels and endothelial function (14). In individuals with type 2 diabetes, regular training reduces A1C, triglycerides, blood pressure, and insulin resistance (15). Alternatively, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) promotes rapid enhancement of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity, insulin sensitivity, and glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes (16,17) and can be performed without deterioration in glycemic control in type 1 diabetes (18,19).</p>
						<h1>Resistance Exercise Benefits</h1>
						<p>Diabetes is an independent risk factor for low muscular strength (20) and accelerated decline in muscle strength and functional status (21). The health benefits of resistance training for all adults include improvements in muscle mass, body composition, strength, physical function, mental health, bone mineral density, insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, lipid profiles, and cardiovascular health (12). The effect of resistance exercise on glycemic control in type 1 diabetes is unclear (19). However, resistance exercise can assist in minimizing risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes (22). When resistance and aerobic exercise are undertaken in one exercise session, performing resistance exercise first results in less hypoglycemia than when aerobic exercise is performed first (23). Resistance training benefits for individuals with type 2 diabetes include improvements in glycemic control, insulin resistance, fat mass, blood pressure, strength, and lean body mass (24).</p>
						<h1>Benefits of Other Types of Physical Activity</h1>
						<p>Flexibility and balance exercises are likely important for older adults with diabetes. Limited joint mobility is frequently present, resulting in part from the formation of advanced glycation end products, which accumulate during normal aging and are accelerated by hyperglycemia (25). Stretching increases range of motion around joints and flexibility (10) but does not affect glycemic control. Balance training can reduce falls risk by improving balance and gait, even when peripheral neuropathy is present (11). Group exercise interventions (resistance and balance training, tai chi classes) may reduce falls by 28%−29% (26). The benefits of alternative training like yoga and tai chi are less established, although yoga may promote improvement in glycemic control, lipid levels, and body composition in adults with type 2 diabetes (27). Tai chi training may improve glycemic control, balance, neuropathic symptoms, and some dimensions of quality of life in adults with diabetes and neuropathy, although high-quality studies on this training are lacking (28).</p>
						<h1>EXERCISE</h1>
						<p>
						Aim for 30 minutes of physical activity 3 to 5 days a week. Exercise can increase your body’s production of endorphins, which are hormones that improve your mood. Exercise improves blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes, reduces cardiovascular risk factors, contributes to weight loss, and improves well-being (1,2). Regular exercise may prevent or delay type 2 diabetes development (3).
